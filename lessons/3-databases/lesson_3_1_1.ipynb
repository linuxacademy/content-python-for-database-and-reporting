    "- Pep 249 documentation can be found [here.](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/)\n",
    "- Provides a blueprint for developers to make database connection packages that are similar\n",
    "- Since the packages are similar, it is easy to learn one for the database you are currently using and transfer that knowledge to any future database you may encounter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connection Objects\n",
    "- a connection object is usually generated with `<package_name>.connect(host, dbname, user, password, port, driver, character set, ...)` \n",
    "- the connection object does not require all of the above parameters, but the connection to your db might\n",
